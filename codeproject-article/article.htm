<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>So it has been a very long time since I wrote an article here at codeproject. 
I have been quite busy on my blog actually, so have been doing more there of 
late. Thing is I kind of heard about this technology years ago, and kind of knew 
what it did, but had never really used it. </p>
<p>That technology is called <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a>, whos 
strap line is &quot;OpenFin OS modernizes financial desktops, enabling instant 
distribution, strong security and application interoperability&quot;.</p>
<p>It just so happens that I am in the business of writing trading apps, it's 
kind of what I do. Those that know me, know that I used to use WPF a lot. 
Those days seem ages ago now. I don't really touch anything UI related at 
all anymore. Crist I was doing Scala and Akka for about 1.5 years, so no UI stuff 
there at all, and my new job is deep server side/cloud. </p>
<p>That said I do enjoy a bit of UI work, and try to keep up to date, and could not quite resist, looking 
at <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a>, even though it is 
probably considered pretty old tech by some by now.</p>
<p>Before I started I did a quick search here at codeproject, and could not 
believe someone has not written about it before to be honest. So I thought 
Ok I need to do this then.</p>
<p>So this article will be about <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a>, 
and also showing the good parts of it, and the not so good parts of it. We 
will also see a demo app written to use OpenFin, and learn more about what
<a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> is.</p>
<p>So in nutshell this article will be about looking at
<a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> and walking through a demo app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What does the final product look like?</h1>
<p>I think the best way to see what the final product looks like is via this 
small video</p>
<p>

<p><i>CLICK TO DOWNLOAD VIDEO</i></p>
<p>Essentially what I have built is a demo app that is like a VERY VERY 
cutdown trading app, it has the following features</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blotter for seeing past trades (in grid form)</li>
	<li>Tiles with FAKE ticking data</li>
	<li>Charts for the tiles, or for the past deals. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are only 3 windows involved this give us enough meat to 
really try oiuut Openfin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What tools will we use along the way</h1>
<p>This is a fairly chunky demo app, and if you do follow along right to the 
end you can expect to have seen, or could see in the source code the 
following technologies in use:</p>
<ul>
	<li>React</li>
	<li>Redux</li>
	<li>Redux thunk</li>
	<li>ES6</li>
	<li>SCSS</li>
	<li>TypeScript</li>
	<li>Express JS</li>
	<li>Parcel JS</li>
	<li>OpenFin</li>
</ul>
<h1>Where is the code?</h1>
<p>The code for this article is actually hosted at Github :<a href="https://github.com/sachabarber/OpenFinWithReactReduxParcel"> 
https://github.com/sachabarber/OpenFinWithReactReduxParcel</a></p>
 
 
<h1>What exactly is Openfin, and what problem is it trying to solve?</h1>
<p>So as stated above <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> think of 
themselves as the OS for the financial space. Why is this? Well 
traditionally financial apps have been very rich in data, and real time 
information, and have required many rich UI elements, such as charts, 
docking, desktop integration (notify icons, system tray, toast 
notifications) that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say this used to be done in a mixture of 
Winforms/WPF and perhaps MFC.</p>
<p>However things have moved on, and a lot of the UIs that were traditonally 
done with these tech stacks are now being done with HTML5. However traders 
are fickle beats and still want their cake and eat it. They like their 
desktop type of apps.</p>
<p>The thing is HTML5 offers something that is quite unique, you write it 
once and run it anywhere.</p>
<p>So that's great, and a lot of places have switched to HTML5 and are all 
happily using the latest Single Page Application (SPA) framework. But there 
is still a need for proper windowed/workspace driven apps. SPA doesnt fit 
for all apps.</p>
<p>This is kind of where <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> fits in, 
where it allows you to write HTML5 applications which are then hosted inside 
an <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> container type framework, where 
the <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> runtime will inject itself 
into your running HTML5 code. There are other <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> 
APIs for different languages, but the HTML JavaScript API is really the main 
use case.</p>
<p>You can kind of think of it like this</p>
<p><img alt="" height="352" src="OpenFin.png" width="400"></p>
<p>Where <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> makes use of the Chromium 
browser stack. You can kind of think of your source ENTRY point HTML as a 
single single page app, you can still have all the usual stuff in it like 
routing etc etc, but if you are trying to emmulate a traditional desktop 
app, it may make more sense to think of one HTML page as one traditional 
form/window in a traditional desktop app.</p>
<p> <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> comes with a few key things 
inside it, namely these</p>
<p><img alt="" height="344" src="OpenFin2.png" width="400"></p>
<p>What is clever about it, is it is capable of being run on 
Windows/Mac/Linux where it will emulate the native windowing of the chosen 
OS. Another important aspect for me is the inter process bus, we will see 
more on this later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Isn't this Electron?</h2>
<p>That was exactly the question I came up with, and I asked this of my 
friend and all round genius and codeproject golden boy Colin Eberhardt, and this 
is what he said:</p>
<p><em><br>One thing to note is that OpenFin is a pretty thin layer on top 
of Electron, so from a technology perspective they are quite similar.<br>
<br>The APIs and features that OpenFin offers are pretty limited and don't 
add that much value. They tend to focus their sales message on a couple of 
things:<br><br>Security, Electron is not secure by default, it adds Node 
APIs directly to the renderer threading. As a result an XSS attack can cause 
havoc! However, they have done a lot of work to create a robust opt-in 
security model (this issue tracks a lot of those changes&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6712">https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6712</a>). 
OpenFin have an electron fork that is secure by default, you have no access 
at all to Node APIs. However, if you don't host third party content in your 
app, XSS is unlikely, and Electron can be used quite safely.<br><br>(Check 
out this video of Chuck, the OpenFin CTO, spreading fear and confusion about 
security!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhY4kdY_0Ho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhY4kdY_0Ho</a>)<br>
<br>Distribution, the OpenFin distribution model involves installing their 
runtime once, with apps downloaded from the internet via a manifest file. 
With Electron you bundle the entire runtime with each app. The OpenFin model 
makes life easier in regulated environments where installation of desktop 
apps is painful.</em><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are are the important parts of OpenFin?</h2>
<p>As I elluded to above, there are a couple of core features that make <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> 
appealing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Native OS windows</li>
	<li>Small distribution that Electron due to not bundling Chromium with 
	every app</li>
	<li>The inter process bus is very useful</li>
	<li>The JavaScript API is quite simple to work with</li>
	<li>The application manifest</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be seeing all of these elements at pay when we disect the demo 
app in the next section.&nbsp;</p>
 
<h1>A Demo Application</h1>
<p>This section will walk through the demo app in some detail, however 
before we get into the detail lets just go through a few things in words</p>
<ul>
	<li>There is a small bar that is the main window, this is called 
	Launcher.html. From here you can<ul>
		<li>Show the trade blotter window</li>
		<li>Show a chart window</li>
		<li>Show the tiles window</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The tile window may be used to send a message on the bus, to the 
	blotter, so simulate a trade being made, where the blotter will add the 
	new row to its list of trades</li>
	<li>The tile window is also able to either show a chart, or update the 
	CCY pair for the current chart by sending a message on the bus</li>
	<li>The blotter window will listen to messages from the tile window, and 
	will add a new trade on this message being receieved</li>
	<li>The blotter window is also able to either show a chart or update the 
	CCY pair for the current chart by sending a message on the bus</li>
	<li>The chart window simply shows a chart for the requested Url or the 
	one requested on the bus</li>
</ul>
<p>So that is what we are trying to build, if you go back and watch the demo 
video again you will see all this in action&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>How to run the demo app</h2>
	<p>So if you do find that you want to run the demo app, this is what you 
	need to do</p>
	<p><strong>Build it</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>open the code folder (find the folder with <code>server.js</code> in it)</li>
		<li>open a node command prompt</li>
		<li><code>npm install</code></li>
		<li><code>npm install -g parcel-bundler</code></li>
		<li><code>npm install -g openfin-cli</code></li>
		<li><code>cd public</code></li>
		<li><code>parcel launcher.html blotter.html chart.html 
		tiles.html </code></li>
		<li>Once its built <strong>CTRL+C</strong> as we <strong>don't</strong> want to use 
		the Parcel web host</li>
		<li>If this worked you should see whole bunch of 
		files in the `public\dist` folder</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Then Run It</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>navigate to root folder with <code>server.js</code> in it</li>
		<li>open a node command prompt</li>
		<li><code>node server</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Bundler</h2>
<p class="auto-style1">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Express Server Side code</h2>
	<p> <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> may be a container but its not 
	magical, for any HTML content, there MUST be something that is responsible 
	for serving this data. For the demo app, this is done using Node and 
	Express. The role of Express in this demo app is fairly important, as it is 
	where the <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> boostrapping occurs 
	where it reads the mainfest file, and also where it provides the various 
	roots to serve the demo application as a whole. In this Express code you 
	will find all the routes possible for the demo application.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> to be able to run the app, 
we need to supply it with a manifest file. This file should be called 
App.json and should contain information about how to boostrap the app. Here 
is the one for the demo app</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I do think
<a href="https://openfin.co/">OpenFin</a> is cool, and there are some cool 
apps written in Electron/OpenFin, and I really like the way they are trying 
to bring back desktop type applications (which traders actually do like 
contrary to what everyones says, its just useful to be able to tab/undock, 
pin, move things around on to a different monitor).</p>
<p>That said the issue that I mentioned above with the OpenFin-Layouts api 
and how that works with Windows (even Windows 10) Scaling, makes it 
completely unusable to run across different monitor/different resolutions. 
So that means this rather appealing service, can't be used unless you know 
exactly what hardware you are going to run stuff on and it has a scaling of 
EXACTLY 100%.</p>
<p>So that aspect sucked badly</p>
<p>The good parts were I found the APIs very easy to work with, and found 
that I could still run my react/redux and Typescript with ease.</p>
<p>So it was perhaps 75% good 25% bad for me overall.</p>
<p>I will let you lot make your own conclusions</p>
